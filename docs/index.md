## Code Of Resistance

In a post-apocalyptic world, where the remnants of humanity fight for survival against a merciless alien invasion, a group of skilled resistance fighters emerges. Among them are Ash, a resourceful scavenger with a sharp wit, Vig, a fearless sniper with unmatched precision, and Sam, a brilliant engineer who can craft ingenious gadgets from scraps.


The aliens, known as the Xalorians, have established a powerful stronghold in the heart of the decimated city. They possess advanced technology and formidable weaponry, making them nearly invincible. The resistance fighters know that the key to defeating the aliens lies in infiltrating their stronghold and disabling their central power source.


To communicate their plans without being intercepted by the Xalorians' advanced surveillance systems, the resistance fighters develop a unique code system. They use a combination of hand signals, encrypted messages, and secret rendezvous points scattered throughout the city. The code constantly evolves, adapting to the Xalorians' attempts to decrypt it.


Ash, Vig, and Sam embark on daring missions, utilizing their individual skills and the power of teamwork to outsmart the alien invaders. Ash's agility and quick thinking help the team navigate dangerous terrain and evade Xalorian patrols. Vig's precision from a distance eliminates key targets and creates distractions. Sam's gadgets and inventions provide crucial advantages, whether it be disabling security systems or creating diversionary explosions.


As the resistance fighters progress, they encounter different types of Xalorian adversaries. The "Reavers" are powerful alien warriors with enhanced strength and speed, while the "Sentries" are heavily armored drones that patrol the streets, scanning for any signs of rebellion. Each encounter presents new challenges and requires careful coordination and strategy to overcome.


As the team gets closer to the Xalorians' central power source, the stakes get higher. The resistance fighters face deadly traps, impenetrable security measures, and unexpected twists in their journey. The Xalorians, realizing the threat the resistance poses, unleash their deadliest weapon, a colossal war machine known as the "Annihilator," capable of leveling entire city blocks with its devastating firepower.


The final battle for humanity's survival culminates in a climactic showdown within the heart of the alien stronghold. Ash, Vig, and Sam must overcome insurmountable odds, outsmart the Xalorians' most advanced technologies, and deliver a crippling blow to their central power source. Failure means the extinction of the human race, while victory offers a glimmer of hope for a future free from alien tyranny.


Will you join Ash, Vig, and Sam in their fight against the alien invaders? Can you decipher the code, outmaneuver the Xalorians, and lead the resistance to victory? The fate of humanity rests on your shoulders in this thrilling battle for survival.

## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the player documentation for Code Character!

Code Character is a strategy-based programming game where you control troops in a turn-based game with the code you write in one of the multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Java) available in the game. The objective is to destroy and vanquish the opponent's territory by writing code and creating defenses via the in-game map. With progress and implementation of new competitive strategies, fight your way through, and dominate the top of the leaderboard.

You can also participate in the daily challenges that challenge your skills in the game by assigning one challenge per day to be solved. You will be awarded a score based on your performance and will hence place you on the leaderboard which can be checked from the Leaderboard page.

There is a PvP Mode, where your troops battle against the opponent's troops. In this game mode, the player whose troops are the last ones standing, wins. The winner will be awarded points based on the number of troops and the type of each troop remaining. You will be placed on a separate leaderboard for PvP matches, which can be checked from the Leaderboard page.

Let’s get started with a quick tutorial on how to get started.

## Dashboard Interface

You need to register to get started. You can register using email verification or using the Google or GitHub OAuth. Once registered, you can use the credentials to login to the game.

Once you log in, you’ll see your dashboard, as shown in the image below.

On the left there is the sidebar, with multiple icons. Lets go through these one by one -

-   **Code Editor** - Where you will be writing code in the language of your choice.
    - The settings button allows you to change basic editor settings.
    - The info button gives you a list of the different shortcuts that can be used.
    - Use the dropdown to change between Normal and PvP Modes.

-   **Map Designer** - Where you will be designing the map by placing the defenses of your choice.

-   **Leaderboard** - Leaderboard shows where you stand among the other players and where you can also initiate a match against others from your tier.
    - The Leaderboard has three pages - Normal, PvP and Daily Challenge. Switch between them to view your position in each mode, and battle against other players.
    - You can start a Normal/PvP match against any player by clicking on the Battle icon in the Leaderboard.

-   **Commits** - This page shows the commit history of map and code which you have saved.

-   **BattleTV** - Your previous matches and their results. You can also watch the replay of the match.
    - There are two pages - Normal and PvP. View the matches of each mode separately. 

On the top, the topbar contains three different icons that take you to different pages. These are -

-   **Profile** - You can logout or check your profile from this menu.

And on the screen, you can see three partitions:

-   **On the left is the editor**, where you can type your code. You’ll notice on logging in, you’re provided with some default code. It doesn’t do much in terms of strategy, but it uses the most important elements of the code API, so a quick glimpse at it will help.

-   **On the bottom right is the debug window**, it shows your compilation errors at compile time, your debug logs and errors at runtime.

-   **On the top right is the renderer window**, which actually displays your game. Use the mouse to pan around, and view your game after it’s complete.
